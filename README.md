# Create P5 Project

## Introduction

An npm / npx starter template for P5 projects using Typescript and Hot Reload preview. This tool simplifies the process of setting up a p5.js project, allowing you to focus on creating fully parametric 2D drawings, 2D animations, and fully interactive vector-based experiences in the browser with ease.

- üìÅ **Automated Structure and Dependency Management**: Automatically creates the necessary folder structure and installs dependencies.
- üé® **Focus on Design**: Spend more time designing and less on setup.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Integrated VSCode Experience**: Recommended extensions and launch configurations for a seamless development experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system to use `npm` or `npx`.

### Installation

To create a new P5 project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm init p5-project <your-project-name>
```

or

```bash
npx create-p5-project <your-project-name>
```

This command will create a new directory with your project name, set up the folder structure, and install all the necessary dependencies.

### Templates

To use a specific template, pass the `--template` argument when creating a new project. For example:

```bash
npm init p5-project <your-project-name> -- --template=screw-and-nut
```

To list available templates you can run:

```bash
npx create-p5-project --list-templates
```

There are currently three templates available:

- `default`: A blank canvas for whatever project you're working on.
- `svg-export`: Contains a screw and nut for you to play with.
- `sound`: Contains a screw and nut for you to play with.

More templates will be added soon, hopefully by contributors too!

### VSCode Integration

- **Recommended Extensions**: The generated `.vscode` directory contains recommendations for helpful extensions. Please review and install them to enhance your development experience.
- **Launch Configuration**: Use the "Launch P5" configuration in the `Run and Debug` section of VSCode. This will open the `design.ts` file, run `npm run dev`, and open the preview browser. 
  - **Note**: The first time you run this, the preview browser may initially display a white screen. Please wait until the debug output indicates that it's safe to reload the simple browser panel.

### Alternatively - Development in other IDEs

If you are **NOT** using VSCode, or if you'd rather run the dev environment manually, then, after setting up your project, navigate to your project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
npm run dev
```

### Preview and Export

- The project uses Vite to provide a hot reload dev server to be able to preview changes to the design any time you save.
- To export to SVG, you can set the `renderSvg` variable to `true` and serialize the SVG html element for download. For an example you can use the `svg-export` template.
